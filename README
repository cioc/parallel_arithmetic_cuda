Hello,

This is my attempt at a parallel, arbitrary precision arithmetic library implemented using CUDA.  The pdf's explain how it works, its successes, and its failures.  

You'll notice lots of problems.  Erm, you're using only one block?  Yeah, the project is still under construction.  Very under construction.  You'll understand when you read the code.  

Cheers,

-Charles
